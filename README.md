# Waterlinked GPS

Waterlinked GPS scripts for Python

Here you can find few quick scripts in Python I did to read from a Waterlinked GPS:

`getposition.py`:: actually, this is the main script to read data from a Waterlinked GPS, just execute it and it will register the data is reading from the Waterlinked GPS into a file named `waterlinked.dat`

`draw.py`:: used to plot with Matplot lib any data file into the screen

`convert.py`:: will let you convert any file craeted by `getposition.py` to GPX and KML files

Inside `data/` folder you can find an example of a `waterlinked.dat` file and the GPX + KML files created by `convert.py`.

Inside `plot/` folder there is a script named `doplot.py` which will create random plots so you can experiment with plotting and several visualizations even if you don't have data.
